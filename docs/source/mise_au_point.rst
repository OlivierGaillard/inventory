Where we are?
=============

Discovering *oscar* --- a Django package to build e-commerce ---- causes me to think about the
future of this site.

Some questions for the future
-----------------------------

- Should I throw away entirely the selling section and replace it with *oscar*?

- Should I replace all the stuff with *oscar*?

- What about a transition to REST and a mobile app? Is a mobile app really useful, for what?

  - selling: ideally with barcode scan
  - quick search within the inventory



What we did
-----------

- I learned a lot for sure, about:

  - Django framework

  - CSS, Bootstrap

  - Git

  - Virtual environments with Python and pip

  - Design of models with Django: abstract model or not.
